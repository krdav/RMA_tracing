## Isotope mass and abundance from IUPAC

Latest IUPAC information lifted from "isotopes-matter":
https://iupac.org/isotopes-matter/




Masses downloaded as csv file:
https://ciaaw.org/data/IUPAC-atomic-masses.csv
Saved as `IUPAC-atomic-masses.csv`


Abundances were not available as csv, therefore html table was donwloaded and saved as `IUPAC-atomic-abundances.html` then processed with Pandas read_html function.
